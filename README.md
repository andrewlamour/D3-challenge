Analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.
The editor of this newspaper wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set used based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). This current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
